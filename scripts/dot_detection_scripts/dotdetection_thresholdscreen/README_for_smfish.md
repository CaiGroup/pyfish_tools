# General workflow for smFISH

Create the following path: seqFISH_datapipeline/dots_detected/Channel_x where x can be 1,2,3, or 4. Copy the optimal_threshold_test_complete_chx.txt (where x is 1,2,3, or 4) into that directory. Fill the values in the text file with Hyb specific thresholds determined from the notebook, and have a single space separating each threshold (first value is for first hyb and so on). Once this is done, run the find_thresh_individual.batch file after adjusting the batch_thresh_individual.py file. This is to get the optimal FWHM for dot detection. Finally, adjust the batch_dotdetection_individual.py file and select the desired threshold set (in case you have various threshold sets in your optimal_threshold_test_complete_chx.txt file). Then, run dotdetection_individual.batch.
