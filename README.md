# seqFISH DASH
Scripts and jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of seqFISH DASH. SeqFISH DASH integrates rolling circle amplification and seqFISH to enable high-throughput profiling of large tissue sections and image a significant number of FOVs in culture. SeqFISH DASH also encodes across channels and utilizes fluorophore-switchable readouts to enable dual encoding of a single readout site. 

### For now, just copy the scripts into a folder named notebook_pyfiles in your raw images directory. 
```
cp -r /path/to/seqFISH_DASH /path/to/raw/images/notebook_pyfiles
```
